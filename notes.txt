Client/front end
  Sketch a design for the front end
  Thinking in react(Componenet planning and frontend build):
    1. start w/ a mock
    2. break the UI into a heirarchy
    3. build a static version
    4. identify the minimal but complete representation of UI state
    5. Identify where your state should live
    6. Add inverse Data flow
  NEXT UP: Continue building the static version
